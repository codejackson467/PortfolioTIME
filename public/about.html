<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey everyone, I'm Jackson Rush. A recent grad from Liberty University, I completed my degree in Application Development
  and Database Development. It was a great time to say the least, but once I graduated, I found myself at an
  internship in DC doing fullstack development for a government contracting agency, and now currently working at a logistics company
  software development!
</p>

<p>My skills include:
  <ul class="skills">
    <li><strong>Programming Languages: </strong>JavaScript C#, Python, and SQL </li>
    <li><strong>Frameworks/Libraries: </strong>ReactJS, BootStrap, .NET </li>
  </ul>
</p>
